        <h1>DivineSign: Unlocking the Miraculous Patterns in the Quran</h1>
        <p>
          DivineSign is a specialized tool designed to help users explore and uncover numerical patterns and word occurrences within the
          verses of the Quran. By providing an intuitive platform for searching and analyzing words and their frequency, DivineSign makes it
          easy to identify meaningful patterns and connections that reveal deeper layers of significance within the text.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>

        <h3>Effortless Search for Word and Number Matches</h3>
        <p>
          DivineSign enables users to search for specific words or numbers throughout the Quran, allowing for an efficient exploration of
          instances and patterns. Whether you’re interested in the occurrences of a particular word, the symmetry of certain phrases, or
          numerical relationships, DivineSign provides instant results to aid in your discovery.
        </p>

        <h3>Splend Creation</h3>
        <p>
          Users can create a <strong>“Splend”</strong> — a shareable post that captures their findings, insights, or interpretations related
          to specific verses and patterns. Each Splend provides a structured format to highlight the verse(s), the pattern or match found,
          and any related reflections or explanations, making it easy to share with others within the app community or on social media.
        </p>

        <h3>Engaging Community Features</h3>
        <p>
          DivineSign includes a built-in social aspect, allowing users to engage with each other's Splends. Users can like and comment on
          posts, sparking meaningful discussions and fostering a sense of community among those exploring the Quran's intricacies.
        </p>

        <h3>Curated Reference Section</h3>
        <p>
          A reference section provides users with links to classic interpretations, linguistic resources, and mathematical analyses,
          enhancing their understanding of the patterns they discover. This ensures that DivineSign is not only a tool for discovery but
          also a gateway to learning.
        </p>

        <h3>User-Friendly Interface</h3>
        <p>
          With a sleek and user-friendly interface, DivineSign is designed for both casual readers and dedicated researchers. The app is
          structured to make the search process simple and engaging, and its social features keep users connected in a supportive and
          inspiring community.
        </p>

        <h3>App Versioning and Updates</h3>
        <p>
          DivineSign is committed to continuous improvement. Each new version incorporates user feedback, enhances search capabilities, and
          introduces additional features to support users in their journey of discovery.
        </p>

        <h2>About DivineSign</h2>
        <p>
          DivineSign was created with love and a dedication to making the study of the Quran accessible, interactive, and meaningful. We
          believe that the beauty of the Quran lies not only in its words but also in the hidden patterns that offer glimpses into a deeper
          understanding of its message.

        <h2>References Used</h2>

        <p>
          The DivineSign app leverages carefully curated resources to ensure accurate, efficient, and accessible search capabilities. To
          achieve this, we utilized the open-source project
          <a href="https://github.com/risan/quran-json" target="_blank">Quran JSON by Risan</a>, which provides a comprehensive and
          well-organized digital format of the Quran. This project includes every verse and Surah, structured in JSON format, allowing for
          precise retrieval and handling of the text.
        </p>

        <p>
          For seamless search functionality, each verse and Surah was stored in a MongoDB database, enabling quick and flexible querying
          using regular expressions (regex). This setup allows users to search for words, numbers, or patterns within the text with minimal
          delay, enhancing the user experience by providing immediate search results.
        </p>

        <p>
          To accommodate various search preferences, we created an additional version of each verse by removing diacritical marks and other
          formations from the original Arabic text. This "formation-free" version enables users to search accurately in Arabic without
          needing exact matches to all marks, ensuring that searches are intuitive and effective.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, these resources and methods support DivineSign's mission of making it easy to explore and engage with the Quran in
          meaningful ways, allowing users to uncover patterns and insights with accuracy and ease.

    <!-- How It Works Section -->
    <nz-card class="about-section" nzTitle="How It Works">
      <div class="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p>
          DivineSign is designed to make it easy to explore word patterns, numerical matches, and hidden connections in the Quran. Whether
          you’re a casual reader, a dedicated researcher, or simply curious, you can follow these simple steps to start discovering
          insights.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Search for Words or Numbers</h3>
        <p>
          Begin by entering a word or number into the search bar. DivineSign will instantly scan the Quran to show you all instances where
          your search term appears, along with its frequency, location, and any notable patterns related to it. This feature lets you
          observe the arrangement and repetition of words in ways you may not have noticed before.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Discover Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          Once you have your search results, DivineSign highlights patterns such as symmetrical phrases, numerical consistencies, or verse
          structures that align with your search. These visual representations make it easy to identify and reflect on the significance of
          certain recurring themes.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Create a Splend</h3>
        <p>
          When you find an intriguing pattern, you can create a <strong>Splend</strong> — a post that captures and shares your discovery
          with others. Each Splend allows you to add reflections, highlight key verses, and provide explanations. This feature is ideal for
          documenting your findings and sharing insights with the DivineSign community.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Engage with the Community</h3>
        <p>
          DivineSign is more than a tool; it's a community of learners and explorers. After creating a Splend, you can engage with other
          users by liking and commenting on their posts. Join discussions on patterns and findings, share ideas, and build connections with
          others who are passionate about discovering the Quran’s hidden intricacies.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Reference and Further Study</h3>
        <p>
          For deeper understanding, the Reference section provides links to classic interpretations, linguistic resources, and mathematical
          analyses of the Quran’s text. This section acts as a bridge to traditional knowledge, enriching your exploration and providing
          additional context for the patterns you uncover.
